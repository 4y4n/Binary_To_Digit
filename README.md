# Binary_To_Digit

The idea for this was to first, code a simple program that would take either a binary input and output the digit conversion or a digit input and output the binary conversion. Once the code had been written and tested, I uploaded it to a TI-84 CE which supports python. From that, there is a fully functional binary to digit and digit to binary converter right on your calculator.
